# Mithaq – Wedding Planning Platform  
Graduation Project | Recruiter Focused Documentation

Mithaq is a full featured wedding planning platform built to solve real problems in the Egyptian wedding market.  
The project demonstrates the ability to design build and deliver a production style frontend application with real backend integration using Supabase.

This repository represents a complete end to end product not a UI demo.

## Project Context

Wedding planning in Egypt is fragmented and stressful.

Couples depend on  
- Facebook groups  
- Manual price comparison  
- Phone calls and messages  
- Unverified recommendations  

This leads to wasted time financial risk and mental pressure.

Mithaq was built to centralize the entire wedding planning journey into one structured trusted digital platform.
